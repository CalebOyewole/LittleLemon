# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Details
I created this project as part of the requirements for completing the Meta Front-end Developer Professional cetificate 

I implemented a booking application on the website for a fictional restauarant called Little Lemon. 


Please note: the only functionality working on this website besides the design is the Reserve a Table function.
